# HTML Documentation Comments Specification
These guidelines define how to add comments to HTML files. Use these conventions to document your HTML documents, sections, and elements for better clarity and easier maintenance.

## 1. HTML Comment Syntax
All comments in HTML must begin with `<!--` and end with `-->`. Anything between these markers is ignored by the browser.

**Example:**
```html
<!-- This is an HTML comment -->
```

## 2. File Header Comments
Place a header comment at the very top of your HTML file to provide meta-information about the file. Include details such as the file name, purpose, author, date, version, and any dependencies.

**Example:**
```html
<!--
  File: index.html
  Description: Main landing page for the website.
  Author: Your Name
  Date: 2025-03-05
  Version: 1.0
-->
```

## 3. Section Header Comments
Use section header comments to clearly delineate major areas of your HTML document (e.g., header, navigation, main content, footer). This makes it easier for developers to quickly navigate through the code.

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Header Section: Contains the logo and primary navigation -->
<header>
  <h1>Website Title</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

## 4. Element Documentation Comments
For individual elements or groups of related elements whose purpose might not be immediately obvious, include an explanatory comment immediately before the element. These comments can detail usage, behavior, or special considerations.

**Example:**
```html
<!--
  Main Content Area:
  This section holds the primary article content along with related widgets.
-->
<main>
  <article>
    <h2>Article Title</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
  </article>
</main>
```

## 5. Inline Comments
Inline comments are used sparingly within an element to annotate specific lines or attributes. These are placed on the same line (or immediately adjacent) to the code they reference.

**Example:**
```html
<div class="container"> <!-- Main container for page layout -->
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

## 6. Special Commenting for Templated or Dynamic HTML
In HTML files generated by server-side scripts or used within CMS templates, comments can be used to indicate areas that are dynamically populated or should not be edited directly.

**Example:**
```html
<!-- BEGIN: Dynamic Content Section -->
<div id="dynamic-content">
  <!-- Content populated by the CMS -->
</div>
<!-- END: Dynamic Content Section -->
```

## 7. Best Practices
- **Be Clear and Concise:**  
  Write comments that explain the *why* rather than restating what the code does. For example, instead of commenting `<!-- Div start -->`, describe the purpose of the division.
  
- **Avoid Over-Commenting:**  
  Donâ€™t comment every single line. Use comments only where additional context is needed.

- **Keep Comments Up-to-Date:**  
  As you modify your HTML, update or remove outdated comments to prevent confusion.

- **Use Consistent Formatting:**  
  Maintain a uniform style for comments (e.g., multi-line block style for headers, single-line style for inline notes).

- **Do Not Include Sensitive Information:**  
  Never place passwords, API keys, or other sensitive data in comments, as these are visible in the source.
